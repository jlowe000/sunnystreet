# This is the first commit of the repo for #VizForSocialGood

This repo contains:

* The data from SunnyStreet.
* The spark flow to import into a database platform.
* The docker file to setup a postgrs database.
* The dva file of the analysis done to date.
* The images from (Oracle Data Science Cloud) - primarily used to determine the distribution of different features / attributes.

The output of the analysis will not be here but as a blog (or two) to describe the story and impact of the analysis.

(As I go I'll update this file with te content and the data).
